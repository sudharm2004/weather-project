WHY IS CORS BLOCKED?
It is to prevent cross-site request forgery. Letâ€™s say you log in to facebook.com and your browser stores the authentication token so that in the future you get logged in automatically. And for every request to the origin facebook.com, these auth-token headers will be present. Now imagine a scenario where you click on a pop-up opening badSite.com. They also have the ability to make requests to facebook.com. In this case, the browser will add related cookies and your token will be shared with badSite.com, and your account has been successfully hacked with a cross-site request forgery attack. To prevent this the CORS error was introduced.
